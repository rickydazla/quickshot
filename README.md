# Quickshot 2.0

This fork includes a fix to allow pages to update if the handle already exists. The original may be found [here](https://github.com/internalfx/quickshot)

A (nearly) full rewrite from Iced Coffee Script to ES2015 JavaScript. Runs on node.js v6+.

The changes consist of mostly cleanup and cruft removal. Adding new features has not been the primary goal.

However, there are a few:

- Allow configurable concurrency level (number of concurrent API requests)
- Show timestamps on all log output

### Installation

`npm install -g quickshot-redux`
